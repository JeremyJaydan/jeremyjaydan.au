      <h2>Driving force</h2>

      <p>I originally went down the path of entrepreneurship to get rich quick, and a decade later I'm still on this path, albeit slow and not in it for the money. I've found a love for the craft, constantly up-skilling, learning, and solving. Even with a passion for the craft though I've still persistently asked myself why I'm doing this, what's the point?</p>

      <p>I've written notes as I've come across different ideas of what it could be but it's my most recent note on the 27th of November that has struck a chord: agency is what matters. The ability to make my own decisions. I've thought about not working for someone as a reason to switch tracks but it seems it may also be a continuous driving force.</p>

      <p>To be motivated by the ability to make one's own decisions is extremely liberating. I thought I needed to figure out point A to point B of product design and development but it seems all it took was just realizing that all I really want out of life is to make it my own.</p>

      <h2>Motivational Notes</h2>

      <p>Writing notes is a bit out of scope for this article I may write about that in a future. For now the context for the following notes is that at the start of the year I quit a freelance gig I had after 4 years and I decided to delete all my notes as they were mixed in with work notes. I probably wouldn't have deleted them in hindsight but that's alright just this year has been a big year for my note taking while I've been focused full time on up-skilling and building my own business.</p>

      <p>This year I've written over 5k notes, 352 of which tagged with 'motivation' as I've tried to discover what drives me. The following are those motivational notes that I hope might be useful to anyone else on a similar journey.</p>
